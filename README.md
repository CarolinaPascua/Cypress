As I firmly believe that the best way to learn a new skill is through practicing, I embarked myself in the process of developing a suite of automation tests through Cypress. I knew as little as I had been taught in a beginners QA course, which was useful but not enough to solve many of the challenges that presented before me in the course of the two days that developing the code for the first module took.

There were a few instances in which I sought my boyfriend's advice, but since he was busy with his own work, I mostly went to Cypress' documentation and Google for help.

The first module, called Elements, is the result of this first challenge with which I presented myself, and the rest is a work in progress that will be updated chapter by chapter as soon as it is ready to be shared.

The website that I am using as example for automation testing is https://demoqa.com/
